## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story

**As a player**, I want to create or join multiplayer Sudoku games where I can collaborate with others in real-time to solve puzzles of varying difficulty levels, earn points based on my performance, and see my ranking compared to other players.

**Game Creation Flow:**
A player creates a new Sudoku room by providing a room name (up to 30 characters, supporting alphanumeric characters and emojis), selecting the grid size (9x9 to 100x100), and choosing a difficulty level (f√°cil, media, dif√≠cil, experto, maestra, extrema). The system validates the room name, generates a valid Sudoku puzzle, and opens the room for other players to join. A game timer starts when the first move is made.

**Playing Flow:**
Multiple players join the room and can see the puzzle in real-time. Each player places numbers in empty cells. When a player places a correct number, they earn points and the change is immediately visible to all players. If a player makes an incorrect move, they are penalized with a 10-second cooldown before they can make another move. The game continues until all cells are correctly filled.

**Post-Game Flow:**
Once the Sudoku is completed, players can view a timeline replay showing every move made during the game, who made each move, and when. Players can see their individual scores, error counts, and updated rankings on the leaderboard.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a logged-in player on the home screen, **When** they click "Create Game", enter room name "üéÆ Mi Sala Epic", select grid size "9x9" and difficulty "media", **Then** a new game room is created with the provided name, a unique ID, a valid Sudoku puzzle is generated, and the player is shown the game board with 0 other players online

2. **Given** a player creating a new game, **When** they enter a room name with 31 characters or invalid characters, **Then** the system displays a validation error and prevents room creation

3. **Given** an open game room with an incomplete puzzle, **When** a player joins via the room list, **Then** they see the room name, current game state with all previously placed numbers, the list of online players, and the game timer

4. **Given** a player viewing an empty cell, **When** they select a number and submit it, **Then** the system validates the move within 100ms and either (a) accepts it, updates the board for all players, awards points, and shows success feedback, or (b) rejects it, applies a 10-second penalty, and shows error feedback

5. **Given** a player who made an incorrect move, **When** they try to make another move within 10 seconds, **Then** the system prevents the move and displays remaining cooldown time

6. **Given** a game with all cells correctly filled, **When** the last correct number is placed, **Then** the game is marked as completed, final scores are calculated for all players, the game becomes read-only, and the timeline replay becomes available

7. **Given** a completed game, **When** a player opens the timeline replay, **Then** they see the room name, a progress bar, and can scrub through the timeline to see each move in chronological order with player attribution

8. **Given** multiple completed games, **When** a player views the rankings page, **Then** they see leaderboards showing: total player points, points per room, total errors, errors per room, and number of games played

### Edge Cases

- What happens when **a player loses connection mid-game**?
  - The player's session is maintained for 30 seconds. If they reconnect, they resume with the same state. If they don't reconnect, they are marked as offline but their score is preserved.

- What happens when **two players try to place a number in the same cell simultaneously**?
  - The system uses optimistic concurrency control. The first request to reach the server wins. The second player receives feedback that the cell was already filled.

- What happens when **a player tries to join a completed game**?
  - The system prevents joining and displays a message "This game has been completed". They can view it as a spectator or access the replay timeline.

- What happens when **the game timer reaches an extremely high value** (e.g., days)?
  - The timer continues counting but may affect bonus calculations. Games inactive for more than 24 hours may be archived or marked as abandoned.

- What happens when **a player makes 100+ errors in a single game**?
  - All errors are tracked. The player continues to receive 10-second penalties for each incorrect move, but there is no additional punishment beyond score impact.

- What happens when **network latency causes move submission delays**?
  - Moves are timestamped on the server. If latency exceeds 5 seconds, the player sees a "slow connection" warning. The game state synchronizes when connection stabilizes.

- What happens when **a player creates a 100x100 grid**?
  - The system must handle the increased data size. Puzzle generation may take longer (loading indicator shown). Rendering optimizations ensure the board remains interactive.

- What happens when **a player uses special Unicode characters or emojis in the room name**?
  - The system accepts all valid Unicode characters including emojis as long as the total character count (not byte count) is ‚â§30. Display rendering handles proper emoji presentation across different devices.
