## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A player joins a multiplayer Sudoku game and sees an empty cell in the grid. They click on the cell to select it, and the cell becomes highlighted. The player then enters a number (1-9). As soon as the number is entered, the system validates whether this number creates any conflicts with existing numbers in the same row, column, or 3x3 box. If the number is valid (no conflicts), it appears in green and is submitted automatically. If invalid (creates a conflict), it appears in red with visual indicators showing which cells are conflicting, and the player can see the error before deciding to change or submit anyway.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** an empty cell in the Sudoku grid, **When** a player clicks on it, **Then** the cell becomes visually highlighted and ready for input, and a number selector appears (keyboard or on-screen buttons)

2. **Given** a selected cell, **When** a player enters a valid number that doesn't conflict with existing numbers, **Then** the number appears in green/blue color, the cell shows a success indicator, and the move is automatically submitted to the backend

3. **Given** a selected cell, **When** a player enters an invalid number that conflicts with the same row, column, or 3x3 box, **Then** the number appears in red, conflicting cells are highlighted, and the player sees a warning message

4. **Given** a player has entered an invalid number (shown in red), **When** they press backspace or click the cell again, **Then** the cell clears and returns to empty state without submitting

5. **Given** multiple players in the same room, **When** player A makes a valid move, **Then** player B sees the number appear in player A's color in real-time without page refresh

6. **Given** a player is selecting a cell, **When** they click a number button (1-9) from the number selector, **Then** that number is entered into the cell and validated instantly

7. **Given** a player selects a cell containing a number, **When** the cell is highlighted, **Then** all cells with the same number in the grid are highlighted in a lighter shade

8. **Given** a player enters a number, **When** validation detects a conflict, **Then** the conflicting cells flash or pulse to draw attention to the conflict location

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a player selects a cell that is part of the original puzzle (pre-filled cell)?
  ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should pre-filled cells be selectable? Typically they are locked]

- How does the system handle rapid number entry across multiple cells?
  ‚Üí Validation must occur for each entry, with debouncing to prevent excessive backend calls

- What happens when a player's move is validated as correct, but another player submits the same move first?
  ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: First player to submit gets the points, second player sees "already filled"]

- How does the system display moves from players with different skill levels or colors?
  ‚Üí Each player should have a distinct color identifier for their moves

- What happens when a player is penalized and tries to submit during the penalty period?
  ‚Üí Current penalty warning should remain, blocking submission

- **FR-026**: System MUST provide a way to deselect the current cell (e.g., clicking outside the grid or pressing Escape)

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Cell State**: Represents each cell in the Sudoku grid with attributes:
  - Position (row, column)
  - Value (0 for empty, 1-9 for filled)
  - Type (pre-filled/original vs player-entered)
  - Status (empty, valid, invalid/conflict)
  - Owner (which player entered the number, if applicable)
  - Selected (boolean indicating if cell is currently selected)

- **Validation Result**: Represents the outcome of validating a number entry:
  - Is Valid (boolean)
  - Conflict Type (row, column, box, or none)
  - Conflicting Cell Positions (list of cells causing conflicts)
  - Conflict Message (user-friendly description)

- **Number Selector State**: Represents the UI control for entering numbers:
  - Available Numbers (1-9)
  - Selected Number (currently chosen number before placement)
  - Visibility (shown when a cell is selected)

- **Player Color Assignment**: Each player in the multiplayer game:
  - Player ID
  - Assigned Color (for displaying their moves)
  - Username (for hover tooltips or labels)

- Visual conflict indicators help players learn and improve their Sudoku skills
- The multiplayer aspect benefits from seeing other players' moves in distinct colors
- The current grid rendering system can be enhanced with client-side validation before backend submission

**Out of Scope**:
- Implementing undo/redo functionality for moves
- Adding hints or auto-solve features
- Changing the Sudoku puzzle generation algorithm
- Modifying the scoring or penalty calculation logic (beyond display)
- Adding mobile-specific gestures (pinch, zoom) for the grid

---

## Success Metrics

- **Validation Speed**: Number entry to validation feedback displayed in < 100ms
- **Real-time Update Latency**: Other players see moves within < 1 second
- **User Engagement**: Increase in average moves per player per session
- **Error Reduction**: Decrease in invalid move submissions due to pre-validation feedback
- **User Satisfaction**: Positive feedback on intuitive interface (survey or feedback mechanism)

## Notes for Planning Phase

This specification focuses on creating an intuitive, real-time Sudoku playing experience similar to popular platforms like Sudoku.com. The key innovation is **instant validation with visual feedback** before submitting moves to the backend, reducing frustration from incorrect moves and improving the learning curve for new players.

Several design decisions are marked as [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] and should be resolved with stakeholders (product owner, UX designer) before moving to the planning phase:

1. **Visual Design**: Exact colors, animations, and icon choices
2. **Auto-submit Behavior**: Whether valid moves submit automatically or require confirmation
3. **Keyboard Navigation**: Full arrow-key navigation support
4. **Player Identification**: How to display which player made which move
5. **Conflict Display Duration**: How long to show conflict highlights

The specification assumes that client-side validation will complement (not replace) server-side validation, maintaining data integrity while improving user experience.
