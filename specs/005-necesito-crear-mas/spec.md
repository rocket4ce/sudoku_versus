## Clarifications

### Clarifications (Session 2025-10-02)

**Q1: What are the target puzzle generation response times for each size?**
A: Ultra-fast targets: 9×9 <50ms, 16×16 <100ms, 25×25 <500ms, 36×36 <1s, 49×49 <2s, 100×100 <5s

**Q2: What is the acceptable move validation latency?**
A: Very fast: <5ms for move validation across all puzzle sizes

**Q3: How many concurrent puzzle generations should the system support?**
A: Light load: Support 10 concurrent puzzle generation requests

**Q4: Should puzzle generation block the UI or run asynchronously?**
A: Blocking with spinner: Display loading spinner during generation, blocking game creation UI until puzzle is ready

**Q5: Should puzzles be generated on-demand or pre-generated and cached?**
A: On-demand only: Generate puzzles when users create rooms, no pre-caching or post-generation caching. Each game room gets a freshly generated puzzle.

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
Game room creators need to generate puzzles quickly without delays, especially when creating rooms with larger puzzle sizes beyond the current 16×16 limit. The system should support instant puzzle generation up to 100×100 grids, enabling new gameplay experiences with massive collaborative puzzles while maintaining responsive game creation and fast move validation during gameplay.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a user wants to create a game room with a 9×9 puzzle, **When** they select the puzzle size and difficulty, **Then** the puzzle and solution are generated within 50ms

2. **Given** a user wants to create a game room with a 25×25 puzzle, **When** they initiate room creation, **Then** the system generates a valid puzzle with pre-computed solution within 500ms

3. **Given** a user wants to create a game room with a 100×100 puzzle on expert difficulty, **When** they request puzzle generation, **Then** the system completes generation within 5 seconds

4. **Given** a player submits a move in an active game, **When** the move is validated against the pre-computed solution, **Then** validation completes within 5ms

5. **Given** up to 10 users are creating game rooms simultaneously with various puzzle sizes, **When** the system handles these concurrent puzzle generation requests, **Then** each request completes within its size-specific timeout without impacting others' response times

6. **Given** a user selects a non-standard puzzle size (e.g., 36×36, 49×49), **When** puzzle generation begins, **Then** the system correctly uses appropriate symbol sets (numbers + letters) for the grid size

### Edge Cases

- What happens when puzzle generation fails for a specific size/difficulty combination? System MUST retry or provide fallback difficulty
- How does system handle more than 10 concurrent generation requests? System MUST queue additional requests or return clear "system busy" message with retry guidance
- What happens when validation is requested for a puzzle whose solution hasn't been fully loaded? System MUST ensure solution data is always available before allowing gameplay
- How does system handle symbol representation for extremely large grids (e.g., 100×100 requires 100 unique symbols)? System MUST support numeric representations beyond alphanumeric
- What happens if puzzle generation takes longer than the size-specific timeout (50ms for 9×9 up to 5s for 100×100)? System MUST communicate timeout error to user and offer retry option
